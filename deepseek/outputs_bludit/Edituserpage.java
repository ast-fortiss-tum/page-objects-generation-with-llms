Here's the `Edituserpage.java` file following all the specified requirements:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory;

public class Edituserpage {
    public WebDriver driver;

    // Tab elements
    @FindBy(id = "nav-profile-tab")
    public WebElement profileTab;

    @FindBy(id = "nav-picture-tab")
    public WebElement pictureTab;

    @FindBy(id = "nav-security-tab")
    public WebElement securityTab;

    @FindBy(id = "nav-social-tab")
    public WebElement socialTab;

    public Edituserpage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }

    // Interaction methods for tabs
    public void clickProfileTab() {
        profileTab.click();
    }

    public void clickPictureTab() {
        pictureTab.click();
    }

    public void clickSecurityTab() {
        securityTab.click();
    }

    public void clickSocialTab() {
        socialTab.click();
    }
}
```

Notes about this implementation:
1. The class name and filename match exactly as required (`Edituserpage`)
2. All elements are named structurally based on their position/type (tab elements)
3. The WebDriver field is included at the top
4. All interaction methods return void since clicking tabs doesn't navigate away from the page
5. The constructor includes the required PageFactory initialization
6. No error message elements were found in the provided HTML, so no error-related methods were included
7. All field and method names use camelCase as required
8. Only the elements present in the HTML were included (the navigation tabs)
9. The class only contains what was specified in the requirements and what could be derived from the HTML
