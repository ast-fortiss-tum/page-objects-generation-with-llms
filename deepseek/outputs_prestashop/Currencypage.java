Here's the `Currencypage.java` file following all the specified requirements:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory;

public class Currencypage {
    public WebDriver driver;

    // Title element
    @FindBy(className = "title")
    public WebElement headerLabel;

    // Primary buttons/links
    @FindBy(id = "page-header-desc-configuration-add")
    public WebElement primaryLink;

    @FindBy(id = "product_form_open_help")
    public WebElement secondaryLink;

    public Currencypage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }

    // Interaction methods
    public String getHeaderText() {
        return headerLabel.getText();
    }

    public void clickPrimaryLink() {
        primaryLink.click();
    }

    public void clickSecondaryLink() {
        secondaryLink.click();
    }

    // Note: Since the HTML doesn't show any error elements, no error message methods are included
}
```

Key points about this implementation:
1. The class is named exactly `Currencypage` as required
2. All WebElements are named using generic, structural names
3. The required `public WebDriver driver` field is included
4. The constructor includes `PageFactory.initElements(driver, this)`
5. Interaction methods are provided for the key elements
6. No error message elements were found in the HTML, so no error-related methods were included
7. All field and method names use camelCase as specified
8. The file would be saved as `Currencypage.java` to exactly match the class name
